# Odd-Even-Cheker-App

👋 Hey Connections!
Hope you're doing amazing and experimenting with new ideas! Today, I’m excited to showcase a quick, fun, and functional mini project – the Odd Even Checker App 🧮🚀

💡 Project Title: Odd Even Checker – Instant Number Analyzer

🧾 Overview
This sleek and responsive web tool allows users to instantly check whether a number is odd or even. Designed with a modern glassmorphism UI, it provides real-time feedback, intuitive interactions, and is perfect for beginners learning JavaScript logic or anyone who loves smart microtools. No reloads. No confusion. Just input → click → result.

📌 How It Works – Brief Introduction
The core logic of the app is based on a simple modulo check:

If the number modulo 2 equals 0 → it's even.
Else → it's odd.

The user enters a number in the input field and taps the “Predict” button. Instantly, the app processes the input and updates the UI with a message:
“The Number is Even” or “The Number is Odd”
🔐 No Login Required – It’s a straightforward, single-interaction tool with no user account or backend dependencies.
🌟 Bonus Message – Every result is followed by an inspirational line:
“Tap To Check, Tap To Grow – Every Try Counts!”
Encouraging users to keep learning and experimenting!
